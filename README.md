# AIML-intern-task-4-feature-encoding-and-scaling-tools
This is all about feature engineering basics

## Dataset ##
Adult Income Dataset: adult.csv

## Actions Performed ##
1. Identify categorical and numerical features.
2. Apply Label Encoding where order exists.
3. Apply One-Hot Encoding where order does not exist.
4. Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
5. Compare model readiness before and after scaling.
6. Explain impact of scaling on ML algorithms.
7. Save processed dataset.

## Deliverables ##
1. Preprocessed dataset - adult_processed.csv
2. Notebook - feature-encoding-scaling.ipynb
